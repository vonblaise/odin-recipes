        <P><h2>Why Cook Turkey In a Bag?</h2></P>

        <p>
            Cooking turkey in a bag keeps the bird
            juicy by trapping in the moisture. It also speeds up the 
            cooking time by trapping in the heat. 
            Plus, you won't have to scrub the roasting pan 
            when you're done, just throw the bag out.
        </p>

        <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>

        <p>Here's what you'll need to make this top-rated turkey in a bag:</p>

        
        <ul>
            
        <p><li><strong>Turkey:</strong> This recipe calls for a whole 12-pound turkey. 
            If your bird is larger or smaller, 
            you'll need to adjust your cooking time.</li></p>
        <p><li> <strong>Seasonings:</strong> The turkey is simply seasoned with 
            just salt and pepper, 
            which allows the natural flavors to shine.</li></p>
        <p><li><strong> Flour:</strong> Two tablespoons of flour keep the bag from 
            bursting and help with browning.</li></p>
        <p><li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> The turkey is roasted alongside onions and celery. 
            For an extra pop of color, add carrots.</li></p>
        <p><li><strong>Turkey Bag:</strong> You should be able to find turkey-sized 
            oven bags at your local grocery store, 
            likely in the aluminum foil and plastic wrap aisle.</li></p>
        
        
        </ul>

        <p>You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below but here's a 
            brief overview of what you can expect when you roast this turkey in a bag:</p>
        
         <ol> 
        
            <p><li><strong>Prepare the Turkey:</strong> Remove and discard the giblets, 
                pat the turkey dry,
                 and season with salt and pepper</li></p>
            <p><li><strong>Pack the Bag:</strong> Sprinkle the bottom of the bag with flour. 
                Place the turkey in the bag along with cut celery and onions. 
                Seal the bag, transfer to a roasting pan, 
                and use a fork to poke several holes in the bag.</li></p>
            <p><li><strong>Roast the Turkey:</strong> Bake in a preheated oven until the 
                juices run clear. An instant-read thermometer
                 inserted into the thigh meat should read 180 degrees F.</li></p>
